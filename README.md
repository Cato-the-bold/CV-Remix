## RGB-D object recognition
Spent several hours to reproduce this paper: Multimodal Deep Learning for Robust RGB-D Object Recognition. Though I know nothing about this topic, it is doable since the model is built upon pretrained AlexNet. \
I cannot directly train the model since the tensorflow I compiled doesn't contain tf.contrib package. Waiting for feedbacks.
